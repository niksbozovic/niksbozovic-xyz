			<p>This research project explores students’ perspectives on the states of cultural institutions and the various crises they’re dealing with. The research was conducted in two phases. The first phase was conducted in December 2024, in the context of the closures of cultural institutions such as Remont, as well as the reduced financial support they dealt with. The second phase in May 2025 functioned as a response to the student movement and as a question about the future of institutions.</p>
			<p>The project problematizes the various futures of the cultural institutions, as well as the problems with which cultural workers deal with, such as the lack of the institutional and financial support, as well as the neutrality, the depoliticisation and decentralisation of institutions. These issues have only become larger during the blockades. In order to study these topics, surveys with students, as well as interviews (“dialogues”) with cultural workers were conducted.</p>
			<p>The research is presented in a digital form through an interactive infographic which consists of the collected data, with an emphasis on the key explanations received from the responders, as well as video recordings of the “dialogues” with cultural workers, which work as a summary and an interpretation of the key findings.</p>
