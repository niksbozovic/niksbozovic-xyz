				<p>Niks Božović is an artist, activist & researcher, centring her work on anti-colonialism, queer studies, visual culture studies and new media art. She believes in radical changes to systems of oppression and in the possibility of a better world. Some of her research is presented here.</p>
				<p>Her work exists in the form of an archive in many senses of that word, from books and zines, to intermedial studies of what cultures can be, how we can preserve cultural autonomy, how we can make changes to current systems, how we can win our rights, how propaganda infiltrates the streets surrounding us.</p>
				<p>Some of her biggest projects have included creating a zine publishing house (<a href="./html/artworks/hartija.html">Hartija</a>), a project representing a sort of an absolute state of the union for how the cultural institutions exist today through the lens of students (<a href="./html/artworks/sta-sada-zelimo-od-muzeja.html">Šta sada želimo od muzeja?</a>), a project exploring the streets of Belgrade looking for political graffiti and finding war crimes (<a href="./html/artworks/krug-dvojke.html">Krug Dvojke</a>), a book documenting the deaths of trans people and building an archive of how they lived through an intersectional lens (<a href="./html/artworks/you-were-all-stars.html">You were all stars</a>), as well as quite a few zines which you can see on this website.</p>
				<p>Niks has been an activist in various queer organisations, cultural institutions and regional trans-related conferences.</p>
